# Fleeyer
A Space Shooter type of game I made some time ago. This is the third iteration of the game. Unfortunately the first one has been lost to time.
The code of the second one too, but the binary has survived and inspection tools can be used to get the source code, if needed.

I made the first version on the 2017 Christmas break to learn Unity and game programming and then came back to it two times to make better versions.
